# JOURNAL.md - Iteration record

Append-only. Newest entry at the bottom. One entry per Ralph iteration: what
changed, why, what was verified, and the single most useful next step.

## 2026-07-01 - A0: Bootstrap Ralph control files

**Task:** A0 (bootstrap). PLAN.md, BACKLOG.md, and JOURNAL.md were all missing,
so per the loop procedure the sole unit of work was to create them.

**What I did:**
- Reoriented from disk: read CLAUDE.md, SKILL.md, and the scanner suite
  (`common.py`, `htmlmeta.py`, `scan_site.py`, `scan_seo.py`, the test file).
  Mapped the as-built architecture and the implicit tool contract.
- Wrote PLAN.md: standing goal, design principles, as-built architecture, the
  normative shared tool contract, the target central-registry design, a phased
  roadmap, and open questions.
- Wrote BACKLOG.md: granular prioritized tasks. Top priority is Phase A
  (central registry A1, then contract-conformance test A2), which closes the one
  explicit gap against the standing-goal contract (scanners are hardcoded in
  `scan_site.py` rather than discovered through a registry).
- Initialized a git repository (none existed). Branch `master`, no remote.

**What I verified:**
- Ran the offline unit suite:
  `python -m unittest test_review_tools` -> `Ran 51 tests ... OK`.
- Confirmed all 8 scanners expose a `scan(...)` returning the checks/verdict
  shape documented in PLAN.md section 4.

**Notes / decisions:**
- Git has no remote, so the loop's `git push` cannot run. Committing locally and
  recording this; no iteration should assume a push succeeded until a remote is
  configured. Logged as an open question in PLAN.md.
- Did not add a NextJS frontend or any app scaffold. This project is a Python
  passive-scanner + docx-report system per its own CLAUDE.md and codebase;
  introducing a frontend would contradict the actual design.

**Next step:** Implement A1 (central tool registry `tools/registry.py`) and
refactor `scan_site.py` to source its scanner set from it with no change to
measured output, then A2 (contract-conformance test).

## 2026-07-01 - A1: Central tool registry

**Task:** A1. Remove the hardcoded scanner wiring in `scan_site.py` and make the
orchestrator discover tools through a central registry, per PLAN.md section 5.

**What I did:**
- Added `tools/registry.py`: a declarative `REGISTRY` of 8 `ToolEntry`
  namedtuples (3 host: http_security, tls, dns_email; 5 page: seo, accessibility,
  links, performance, readability), each with `tool_id`, `key`, `module`,
  `scope`, `category`, `label`. Helpers `host_tools()`, `page_tools()`, `by_id()`.
- Refactored `scan_site.py`: dropped the 8 direct scanner imports and the
  hardcoded `PAGE_SCANNERS`/host-scans dict. `PAGE_SCANNERS`, the host-scan set,
  the scorecard categories, and the host-issue collection now derive from
  `registry`. Generalized the host-issue loop (previously per-scanner special
  cases) into one loop that is provably equivalent (see below).
- Added 5 tests (`TestRegistry`) asserting the registry lists all 8 scanners,
  every entry exposes a callable `scan`, `scan_site.PAGE_SCANNERS` equals the
  registry projection, scorecard categories come from the registry, and `by_id`
  round-trips.

**Why the generalized host loop is safe:** I traced every `scan()` return shape.
`http_security` and `dns_email` always return a `checks` map (or, on a
`_safe_scan` exception, `{ok:false, error}` with no verdict); only `scan_tls`
emits a bare top-level `verdict` (on handshake failure). So the new
`if "checks" in sr ... elif verdict in (warn,fail)` loop reproduces the old
behavior exactly for all three.

**What I verified:**
- `python -m unittest test_review_tools` -> `Ran 56 tests ... OK` (was 51).
- Smoke run `scan_site.py https://example.com`: completed, all 8 categories
  present. Confirmed the combined JSON is shape-identical to before: `host_scans`
  keys = {http_security, tls, dns_email}, page-scan keys unchanged, scorecard
  categories unchanged (security correctly mapped from http_security), issue
  labels unchanged (accessibility still tagged `a11y`).

**Notes:** No design shift; the registry was already the planned design. Marked
PLAN.md gap #1 closed and updated section 5 to "implemented". Git still has no
remote, so commit is local only.

**Next step:** Implement A2 (contract-conformance test) using `registry.REGISTRY`
to enforce the section-4 contract for every current and future tool.
